# Analyzing the UK Top 100 Songs Chart

## Thesis

This project is aimed at determining if the month of a song's release affects it's lifespan on the top 100 chart.

The data was found on the website: https://www.officialcharts.com/. This included weekly charts from 2015 to 2019.


# What I found:

During the initial EDA, I found that there was a total of **2605 unique songs** with an overall average lifespan of **9.98 weeks**. 

Some filtering was needed as there was a significant number of songs that had a lifespan of only 1 week.
